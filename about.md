My name is Craig Cabrey. I am an undergraduate and graduate student at the
Rochester Institute of Technology where I study Software Engineering. I will be
graduating in the summer of 2016 with a Bachelor of Science and a Master of
Science in Software Engineering.

My strongest interests are in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I'm been
enthralled by Free software ever since I was in grade school and have been
using it for at least that long. My favorite piece of software is, without a
doubt, Linux (although Git is a close second).

I started this site to have a place to put my thoughts and knowledge, in the
hopes that it eventually finds an interested reader. Hopefully you find
something useful here! If you find a mistake, feel free to open an issue at the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/craigcabrey/craigcabrey.github.io).
