For my last semester in school, I am enrolled in the Humanitarian Free and Open
Source software course at RIT. This course is part of the
[FOSS minor](http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html) sponsored in part by RedHat.

One of the primary goals of the course is to use as many free software
techniques of communication as possible (e.g. IRC, mailing lists, and so on).
Hence, this blog will be an outlet for me to show progress towards various
course goals throughout the term.

The blog itself is a Jekyll blog hosted via GitHub pages. This means I don't
have to worry about hosting (well, unless GitHub goes down ;) but have the
flexibility of a Jekyll based site.

So be sure to check back here for more updates (I'll prefix the titles of
related posts with HFOSS).
