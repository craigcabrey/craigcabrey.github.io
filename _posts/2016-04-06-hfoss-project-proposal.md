## Team Proposal

### Team Members

Craig Cabrey - [redacted]@rit.edu

Ben Kantor - [redacted]@rit.edu

Jim Arnold - [redacted]@rit.edu

### Which project did your team choose?

A 2D platformer where the player must solve problems in order to make
progress in the world. Our original concept involved the player as a hurdler
trying to “hurdle” math problems to win the race.

### What will each team member's role be?

* Jim Arnold
  * Graphics Wizard
  * Game Design Consultant

* Ben Kantor
  * Head Gold Plater
  * Scope Creeper
  * Idea Guy

* Craig Cabrey
  * Python Consultant
  * Linux Consultant

### Source Code Repository URL

https://github.com/craigcabrey/math-hurdler

### What are the easy parts?

* Scaffolding the project
* Identifying the scope of the game

### What are the hard parts?

* Lack of experience with pygame
* Team coordination

### How will you overcome both?

In order to learn PyGame, we plan to go over some tutorials available online.
There are PyGame tutorials available on the PyGame website
(http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials) and we found a tutorial for making a
Sugar activity with PyGame on flossmanuals
(http://en.flossmanuals.net/make-your-own-sugar-activities/making-activities-using-pygame/).

We will be using Facebook Messanger, email, and the Github issue tracker to
communicate. In addition to those virtual sources, we also plan to meet after
class on Mondays and Wednesdays.
